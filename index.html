<h1>Satisfactorization</h1>
<factorization-splitter-system-calculator></factorization-splitter-system-calculator>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is a specialized calculator meant to be used for designing division (normal splitter) based splitter systems
    for <a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/">Satisfactory</a>.</p>
<p>It uses <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor">gcd</a>
    and <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factorization">prime factorization</a>, and adds necessary loop-backs to
    calculate what layers of splitters and mergers is needed. This gives a compact representation of a possible solution for the
    system; in the form of a layer list, and merge counts. Keep reading to understand how to interpret this representation.</p>

<h2>How To Use</h2>
<p>
    Don't. <a href="https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Manifold">Manifolds</a> are in most cases sufficient, and advanced
    splitter systems is mostly redundant. Unless it's for fun, /g or if it's necessary for good sleep. /j

    NOTICE: There may be calculation errors, and you are responsible for the negative consequences of usage of this tool.
    Including the hours lost to debugging your factory. :)
</p>

<p>
    NOTICE: When the words input and output are used, it refers to the splitter system's input and output.
    Not machine input and output.
</p>

<b>Parameters</b>
<p>
    Specify how many belts you want, and their rates. Increasing the count, clones the last belt.
</p>
<p>
    NOTICE: Rounded numbers can result in more complex splitter systems.
    Using exact numbers usually gives much better results.
    Note that the game, and a lot of <a href="https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Online_tools#Factory_planners">satisfactory planner tools</a> display rounded rates in a lot of places.
    Make sure to interpret them correctly to get the exact rates.
    In this tool, you can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal#Notation">fraction notation
    like "10/3" or parentheses notation like "3.(3)"</a> for numbers with repeating decimals.
</p>

<b>Interpret the Solution</b>
<p>
    The splitter system will consist of two components, the splitter component and the merger component.
    The splitter component splits the items in belts with equal rates, these rates will then be merged together to the
    requested output rates.
</p>

<p>
    The layers describe the splitter component. It is a list containing only twos and threes, and corresponds to two-way
    or three-way splitters. Begin with the input belt.
    For every item in the list, split all the belts from the previous layer (or input, if it's the first layer), in to
    two or three (based on the current list item). This can be done in any layer.
</p>

<p>The "Output Merging" represent the merging component.
    It shows how many belts from the last layer in the splitter component (right column),
    must be merged to get a certain rate (left column).
    If all the outputs are equal, then no merging is needed (hence all the outputs only needs one last layer belt).
</p>

<p>
    Loop-backs shows how many last layer belts must be merged back to the input. Keep in mind that loop-backs increases
    the required capacity of the belt after it is merged with the input.
    The rate after input and loop-back is merged will be: input + input * loop-backs / total number of last layer belts (I think...).
    Keep in mind that loop-back systems will take a short time before the system is fully propagated.
    This means that the ratio will always be correct, but the rate will start a little lower than expected
    (The rates will still be correct much faster than with manifolds).
</p>
<p>
    <i>Actually, with loop-back systems, the rate will theoretically never reach the desired rate. But the actual rate approaches the desired rate so fast, it is negligible.</i>
</p>

<p>Keep an eye out for redundant splitter-merger pairs! They are common.
    If all the belts from a splitter is merged back together for the same output belt (or loop-back), you don't have to split it in the first place.
    These simplifications may be several layers deep.
